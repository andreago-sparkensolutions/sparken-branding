# Test Document for Sparken Branding

## This is a Level 2 Header

This is regular body text that should appear in the standard text color (#030403).

### Level 3 Header in Purple

All headers should be in Deep Cognitive Purple (#5E5592).

## Key Features to Test

* Logo should appear in top left corner
* Watermark should be visible but subtle
* Headers should be purple
* Footer should show page numbers in purple
* No "Built for the Brain" text anywhere

### Another Section

This document tests the Sparken branding implementation to ensure:

1. Proper color usage
2. Logo positioning
3. Watermark visibility
4. Header styling

## Final Section

**Bold text** and *italic text* should work properly.

The footer should only show "Page X of Y" on the left and "Sparken" on the right, both in purple.
